Kanji Android App
=================

This Android App was developped in Fall semester 2012 as a project for a Software Development class. The team called
PrometheusTech consisted of three people. 
The purpose of this application is to aid students who are taking Japanese courses at Macalester College so they
could practice to read and write Kanji.
The app was built in the span of approx. 3 months, but it is not fully finished. The missing pieces are a better evaluation
system, progress tracking and the contents of the textbooks used in Japanese courses.
